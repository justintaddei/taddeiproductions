# The Keep It Fun Checklist

There are basics to every shoot regardless of it is a photo or video
shoot, there are also quirks of the photographers and videographers, you
should consider. I'm writing this to ease guilt for my failure to
communicate but it should also be a handy guide that will help with any
shoot with any photographer or cinematographer (videographer).

All of what's below will help you get more out of what you are coming for.

Everyone operates differently but knowing the simple stuff makes everything work
better. Remember, it is the job of the guy behind the glass to collect the
light reflecting off the subject so our photos or videos will always look
better if we start with a good looking subject!
   
   
## Basics

Remember what your goal is. If a corporate photo is all you're after, then
you'll want to look corporate. We'll put you in front of a background that
fits your companies picture page and away we'll go. If you're an actor or
model, however, you'll want to present as many expressions and possible
acting types as possible in the fewest pictures. Think of your pictures as
a quick pop song. You'll turn the song off in the first few seconds if the
intro doesn't catch your attention and you'll get bored or turn it off if
there isn't something more than a good intro.

## Changing Your Looks

Changing your look during shoots takes time but it's necessary. Some basic
planning makes things go much faster. If you can plan your changes of
clothing to be quick, not destroy your hair, nor wipe your makeup off, (or
sweat you to death) you've just made yourself look and feel better and
you've just increased the productivity of the shoot.

Here are some examples of how to speed things up:
- Let's say you want to present yourself as a wall street tycoon in a suit, but you know that you only want a chest up photo. Don't wear a suit, just wear a shirt tie, and jacket. So, you think, I'm a muscle man and need to have a tough guy shot of some swim shorts and muscle shirt&#8230; Well, how about wearing those shorts and a muscle shirt and doing that image set first. Later you can put the top end of that suit over what you have on. You just saved another bunch of time, stayed cool in what might be a hot room or outdoor environment, and didn't slow the creative pace too much with changing out.  
Everyone has their set of types to bring to life so work with your ideas and minimize the time it takes for changes.  
The same idea goes for makeup, and remember unless your type is a makeup queen, your makeup should look as natural as possible.  
Items to Change Your Look &amp; Appearance  
(while some of this is obvious, some may not be)  
make-up

- hair ties &amp; rubber bands (so you can wear your hair in different ways)
- hats
- jewelry
- glasses/sunglasses (Don't wear sunglasses before the shoot because they usually make you end up squinting and give you watery eyes)
- anything you think might make a neat prop or look interesting in a photo.
- You will want to bring a small mirror and any tools you normally use to make yourself look like you want to look.
- Depending on the styles you wear, you might also want to include a skin-toned thong &amp; bra. (men may skip this recommendation&#8230;although I can see an SNL skit here)
- Think drink! It's a good idea to bring something to drink especially if
you'll be outside. Bringing a cooler with ice is smart not just for
drinks but also anything else you wish to keep cool while shooting. One
of my favorite things to have is a frozen wet washcloth in a plastic
bag. I keep a few in my freezer for the occasional sore
something/anything too.
- Bring something to eat or snack on but be careful and mindful of what you bring. If you are planning on wearing a $3,000 white wedding dress, please don't plan on snacking on soft chocolates and red wine but if you do, please tell me in advance so I can get some B-roll of you going insane when you realize why I wrote this.

Models and actors are usually expected to bring their wardrobe to shoots.
If you plan to shoot photos of a certain style, you should coordinate with
your photographer beforehand to discuss wardrobe options as well as props,
backgrounds, and various ideas. The all in one type of shoot requires the
most forethought. Bring a variety of different types of clothes. Most
photographers prefer to have a variety of options anyway. If you think you
might want to bring something but have second thoughts, bring it anyway. I
bring gear I think I won't need because if I do find I need it I would
hate to kick myself in the butt.

Don't forget your goals which means a plan for the proper wardrobe. Some
suggestions are:

- Shorts
- Various forms of full and brief tops
- Mini dresses
- Mini skirts
- Form-fitting pants
- Sports &amp; fitness gear
- Business suit
- 1<sup>st</sup> Responder uniforms


Staying light and mobile with all your stuff!

Many models a small rolling suitcase or bring a bag of some type to carry
all their clothes. If you plan to shoot on location, it is important that
bring something that allows you to transport at least three or more
outfits easily. Make sure you don't wrinkle your clothing or cover them
with lint. If you might need a steamer or iron, make sure there is one and
there will be a place to plug it into AC. Never let your dog sleep in your
suitcase, that is what your sofa and bed are for.

Sometimes you'll be lucky to have a trailer, a clothing rack, or some
other form of convenience with privacy. If not, then plan for that too.
It's one of those things you need to pick up a phone and call for. For
young people, that means using that app on your private pocket computer
that looks like a banana with ball ends. You initiate vocal communication
by typing in a number referred to as a phone number. It usually has 10
digits total and when used correctly, a voice will appear on your pocket
computer and do this thing called verbal communication. It's amazing how
fun old-fashioned communication can be. We have a word for it - talking!


The above-mentioned step of talking is highly recommended for a successful
shoot. Following this final step will add much light to all the rest of
the questions you may have. No animals will be harmed while talking unless
my dog tries to eat my sandwich from my lap.
